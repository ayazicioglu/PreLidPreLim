Here, a dataset is created from a pandas dataframe. Instead of the example csv, we should write our own file name. 
A new dataset is created via HuggingFace and loaded into that dataset from here. The dataset is divided into training and test data.

dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(input)
dataset = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.1)

#Print the dataset
print(dataset)

dataset.push_to_hub("ayazicioglu/PreLidPreLim")
